## Your PyBites Code Archive

In this zipfile you will find all the code you submitted on the platform.
Note that we rotate "bite saves" so you will find max. last 5 commits per Bite.
Each filename also shows if the submission passed or failed on our platform.

We hope you collected a lot of Pythonic snippets along the way to show of your Python ninja skills!

Please let us know if you have ideas / needs for new Bites.
You can use the "What intro Bites would you like to see here?" comment boxes for each Bite level here:

Keep calm and code in Python!
